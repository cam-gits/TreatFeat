# TreatFeat
A simple game for the Panic Playdate; created in 24 hours for PlayJam 6.

This is my first “finished” game and my first jam, so expect some jank.

I coded everything over 24 hours using the Playdate SDK with two additional libraries; Whitebrims [Animated Sprite Helper Class](https://github.com/Whitebrim/AnimatedSprite) and SquidGodDevs [Playdate Scene Management](https://github.com/SquidGodDev/Playdate-Scene-Management).

Sounds are licenced from Ovani, title font is _Curse of the Zombie_ by imagex (now with added dithering)

All other assets are my own and created over the jam.
